# Shell-Scripts
Some Bash scripts I've written.

## colorpallete.sh
Creates a PNG color palette image with the most common colors contained in another image. Just execute the script via the terminal and you'll be prompted to enter the path to the source image and destination folder. Example:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G0olWDV.png" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pNjQHUm.jpg" />


## mufire.sh
Multi-file Rename. Allows all the files in a directory to be renamed identically along with an incrementing counter. I wrote the to batch rename images, but it works with any file type.
